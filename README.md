# ¿Cómo Te Llamas? 🦙

(Lessonly employees call ourselves “llamas” 😉)

This is a small, simple Phoenix LiveView app that turns the [Lessonly Team page](https://www.lessonly.com/team/) into a set of flashcards to help me and others learn our colleagues’ names. [Check it out here!](https://namegame.stevegrossi.com/)

## Development

Clone the repository.

You’ll need Erlang and Elixir installed. [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) makes this as easy as running `asdf install` from the project directory.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
